# PPO_benchmark

The goal of this project is to provide a benchmark of various RL algorithms using gymnasium and stable_baselines_3

- The parameters of the experiments such as the environnement and the algorithm can be specified in the .yaml config file and are independent from the code
- The logging is done through wandb and shows video snippets of rollouts at different moments in the training
